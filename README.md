# ProgramAT

This repository contains code for an AI-powered assistive technology platform, ProgramAT. ProgramAT equips blind or low-vision (BLV) users to create custom camera-based assistive technologies via natural language instructions. BLV users can test their camera-based ATs with input from their iPhone's camera. The system has 3 major components:
- a mobile app, installable via TestFlight. Link will be provided closer to the event.
- a server that runs the computation for the camera-based AT you build using the app. This interfaces with a GitHub repository, and runs the AI models necessary for your task. Instructions to set a server up will be updated shortly.
- ProgramAT GitHub repository. This is where your tools will live. It will be a fork of this repository for each individual user. We recommend forking closer to the event date.

> Notice: Setup instructions and TestFlight link will be updated closer to the event.


## What is the ProgramAT Mobile App?

This is a React Native app that facilitates AT creation, iteration, and testing of the created AT using your camera feed. You can also monitor the status of their creation. The app streams frames to a Python backend on your server, which executes pluggable tools — object detection, OCR, scene description, and more and returns spoken feedback.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/). Refer to [screen reader friendly instructions by Jeff Bishop](https://community-access.org/git-going-with-github/docs/00-pre-workshop-setup.html).
- A computer with decent compute capacity, or ability to host a VM with decent compute capacity. Exact specifications coming soon. A GPU is not required.
- A screen reader and an accessible web browser.
- iPhone 12 or higher running iOS 26. Apple Intelligence or AI-specific features for processors are not required.
- Python 3.11+ (for the backend server)
- Node.js >= 20
- Optional: React Native CLI development environment ([setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment)). This is required if you want to run and install the app. You can skip this requirement if you are installing the app using our TestFlight link.
- Optional: For iOS: Xcode and CocoaPods. You can skip if you are building and running the app.


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/program-at/ProgramAT-opensource.git
   cd ProgramAT-opensource
   ```

2. Optional (required if you are building the app): **Install React Native dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ProgramATApp
   npm install
   ```

3. Optional (required if you are building the app): **Install iOS dependencies (iOS only)**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Create the backend `.env` file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

6. **Fill in the values in `backend/.env`**
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - `GITHUB_REPO`
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` if you use OCR tools

### API Keys

The backend reads configuration from `backend/.env` automatically when it starts, or from environment variables if you set them directly.

Use the table below as a quick reference for what each value does.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Yes (for VLM tools) | Google Gemini API key used by scene description, clothing recognition, AI parsing, and Gemini Live |
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` | For OCR tools | Google Cloud Vision API credentials used by Live OCR |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | For GitHub features | GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Yes (to access your own tools) | Target repo in `owner/repo` format |
| `HOST` / `PORT` | Optional | Server bind address (default `0.0.0.0:8080`) |

#### Alternative: Set environment variables directly

Instead of using `backend/.env`, you can export the variables in your shell before starting the backend:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export GITHUB_REPO="username/your-programat-fork"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/credentials.json"
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_key_here"
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = "your_token_here"
$env:GITHUB_REPO = "username/your-programat-fork"
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "C:\path\to\credentials.json"
```

### How to Get the Keys

#### GitHub Token

1. Go to any GitHub page: <https://github.com/>. Click your profile picture (top right) and open **Settings**.
2. Go to **Developer settings** -> **Personal access tokens** -> **Tokens (classic)**.
3. Click **Generate new token**.
4. Add a note, choose an expiration, and select scopes to be **repo**.
5. Click **Generate token**, copy it and save it properly. You won't be able to see it again.
6. Paste the token into `backend/.env` as `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

#### Gemini API Key

1. Go to Google AI Studio: <https://aistudio.google.com>
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Get API key** -> **Create API key**.
4. Select an existing Google Cloud project or create a new one, then click **Create API key**.
5. Copy the generated key.
6. Paste the key into `backend/.env` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

Billing:

- If you want to increase the rate limit, click **Set up billing** in Google AI Studio and choose other plans for your API key.

#### Google Application Credentials

This project uses Google Cloud Vision for higher-quality OCR in `tools/live_ocr.py`. If you want Cloud Vision for better OCR, create a service account and download a JSON key, then set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to that file path. If you prefer not to use Cloud Vision, the tool will fall back to local Tesseract if installed (no Google credentials required).

Steps:

1. Go to Google Cloud Console: <https://console.cloud.google.com>
2. Create or select a project and enable the **Cloud Vision API** in **Menu** -> **API & Services** -> **Enabled APIs & services**.
3. Create a service account: **Menu** -> **IAM & Admin** -> **Service Accounts** -> **Create service account**. Fill name/ID and click **Continue**.
4. Create a key: for this service account, select **Actions** -> **Manage Keys** -> **Add key** -> **Create new key** -> choose **JSON** -> **Create**. A JSON file `credentials.json` will be downloaded. Save it securely into your workspace.
5. Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the JSON file path.

Security notes:

- Do not commit the JSON key to version control. Add `credentials.json` to `.gitignore`.
- Restrict the service account to only the Vision API and grant the minimal needed permissions.

### Running the Application

#### Run the server

If you have already completed the Installation section above:

1. **Activate the virtual environment and start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python stream_server.py
   ```

   The server listens on `0.0.0.0:8080` by default.

#### If you want to run the app locally for development

1. **Install React Native dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ProgramATApp
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Metro**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Run the app on a device or emulator**
   - Android: `npm run android`
   - iOS: `npm run ios` on macOS only

#### WSL networking notes

- If you run the app on an Android emulator, point the WebSocket server URL to `ws://10.0.2.2:8080`.
- If you run the app on a physical phone, use the IP address of the machine or WSL2 instance that can be reached from the phone.
- If you want to use the built-in server presets, update `ProgramATApp/config.ts` with a local server entry or change the default WebSocket URL.

### Configuration (will be updated closer to event)

Server URLs are managed in `ProgramATApp/config.ts`. The app supports multiple named servers selectable via a secret code in Settings:

```typescript
export const SERVER_CONFIGS: Record<string, { url: string; name: string }> = {
  'default': { url: 'ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8080', name: 'Default Server' },
};
```

Switch between **Development** and **Production** modes in the Settings tab.

## Usage

1. **Connect** — The app auto-connects to the configured server on launch. Connection status is shown in the UI; a loading sound plays while connecting.

2. **Select a Tool** — Navigate to the **Tools** tab, browse the available tools, and tap one to select it.

3. **Run** — The Tool Runner opens with a live camera preview. Tap **Run** to execute the tool on single frames, or **Stream** to process frames continuously. Results are spoken aloud via TTS.

4. **Chat** — After a tool run, tap **Chat** to ask follow-up questions about the result (powered by Gemini).

5. **Development mode** — Use the **PRs** tab to browse open pull requests, select one to load its tools, and send text updates to GitHub issues.

Creation instructions coming soon.


 
## Supported Input Modes

- **Streaming mode** — Tools process frames continuously and return real-time audio feedback
- **Single-frame mode** — Capture one frame and get a detailed result
- **Real-time camera streaming** at configurable FPS via `react-native-vision-camera`
- **Conversation mode** — Ask follow-up questions about tool results via a Chat tab
- **Custom GPT-like tools** — Tools flagged as Custom GPT use Gemini Live for streaming multimodal conversations instead of executing code per frame

## Supported Feedback Modes

- **Text-to-Speech feedback** — all tool results are spoken aloud automatically
- **Rich audio output** — tools can return speech, beeps, haptic vibration, earcons, and more via the AudioOutputService
- **Speech-to-Text input** — voice input for follow-up questions using `@react-native-voice/voice` and OS-level dictation

## Usage Modes
### Development Mode (GitHub Integration)
- **PR browser** — List open pull requests, select one, and load its tools
- **Text input for issues** — Create or update GitHub issues with AI-powered parsing (Gemini)
- **Multi-turn conversations** — The server asks for missing fields until the issue is complete
- **Copilot session logs** — View AI coding session summaries per PR

### Production Mode
- Tools are pulled from the `main` branch only
- The PR browser tab is hidden; users go straight to the tool list

## Built-In Tools

| Tool | Description | Model |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Object Recognition** | Detects and announces objects using YOLO11 + COCO | YOLOv11 |
| **Live OCR** | Reads visible text aloud in real time | Google Cloud Vision API |
| **Scene Description** | Generates a spoken description of the scene | Google Gemini Vision |
| **Camera Aiming** | Guides users to center an object for a well-framed photo | YOLOv11 |
